# Outbreak Ambush

## Inspiration: Asteroids meets the zombie apocolipse

## Summary: 
- You've found yourself on the run from zombies. They've chased you into an open field. You're surrounded. You must fight for your survival as long as possible. On the bright side, you have unlimited amunition and 3 lives, and the zombies can't see during the day so they only run in straight lines. 

## How to play:

- Use the up/down keys or "w"/"d" keys to move forwards and backwards
- use the left/right keys or "a"/"d" keys to rotate left and right
- use the space bar to fire.

## How to Win: 
* Defeat all zombies in each of 3 rounds. 
* Player can continue to play after the third level is completed for a high score.
* The next round will automatically start. 

## How to Lose:
- Lose a life when a zombie gets close enough to bite you!
- Lose the game when you lose all 3 lives.

## Point System: 
- Each zombie fended off will bank you 10 points. 


## Work Schedule: 
### Tuesday: 
- - Set the scene: Create canvas and player.
### Wednesday: 
- - Movement: Get player to move around and fire. Get zombie to generate and move in straight line. Get player to lose a life on collision with zombie.
### Thursday: 
- - Kills: Get player to lose a life on collision with zombie. Get zombie to disappear on collision with shot. 
### Friday: 
- - Beginning and end: Create beginning/end of round. Create game over. 
### Saturday: 
- - Keep score: add 10 points every time zombie is killed. Display score at end of game.
### Sunday: 
- - Progressive Difficulty: after 3 levels (win state), player can continue to play for high score. At every round, generate more zombies and make them faster.
### Monday: 
- - CSS: player art, zombie art, bullet art, background design, start game and end of game design.

## Stretch Goals:
- Introduce a night mode every 2 minutes where zombies can see you and will run straight towards you.
- Introduce boss zombies that when shot, break off into smaller zombies.
